#                                                     **Exception Handling and Pickling in Python**


## **Introduction**
This page describes how I worked on Assignment07. It has some links from the web that describe how Pickling and Exception Handling work in Python. There will be 2 scripts that demonstrate how Pickling and Structured error handling work and explain what these scripts do.

## **Web Research on Exception Handling and Python**

For Exception handling I found the following webpages really helpful:
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp (external site)
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/exception-handling-python/ (external site)
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_exceptions.htm (external site)

The first one is relatively short, it has many examples that helped me to understand how Exception works. I like starting from short, simple explanations and then build up more content on them. Then the next 2 links provide more details and descriptions. They outline at the beginning what they cover, also the third one has behind the scene diagrams showing how the program works. 

For Pickling I found these webpages really valuable:
*	https://www.pitt.edu/~naraehan/python3/pickling.html (external site)
*	https://stackabuse.com/introduction-to-the-python-pickle-module/ (external site)

Again, the first link didn’t have a lot, but it helped to understand fast the concept of pickling. Then the next link gives much more details and theory. I really liked it gave some explanations from a developer’s perspective.
